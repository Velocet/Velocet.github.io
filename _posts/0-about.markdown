there we are. trying out new features and the all new tinypress. since this is my first entry here, i'm gonna write about what i'm doing on github and what i want to achieve. at the moment i am mainly involved in uefi and its inner workings. the other big thing that has my attention is some sort of powershell repository that keeps all scripts you want to execute after you finished a fresh install so that your system is in the state where you left off your old installation.

i use github mainly for two things:
1. save all my projects and ideas that need some versioning or combine (fork) available repos into one big thing
2. contribute to other projects (mainly because i'm mad about a feature lag or setting)

my main working enviroment is windows. i also use linux via vm when the need for a good terminal kicks in. my main distri was slackware but it became harder and harder to run such a system for everyday use and since you are getting older you want a little more comfort. so i am now using mint (cinnamon), debian (i3, gnome) or xubuntu. visual studio and the new visual studio code really do a good job. the rest gets managed via powershell and other little tools.

on github i only want to use opensource software and stick with the opensource and openknowledge idea. if you have any questions, feedback, etc.: just drop me a line ..
